Welcome to ms-van3t's documentation!
===================================

![](img/MS-VAN3T_logo-V2_small.png)

**ms-van3t** provides ns-3 modules to build and simulate ETSI-compliant VANET (V2X) applications using SUMO (v-1.6.0+) and ns-3 (ns-3-dev, version supporting the NR-V2X module by CTTC), with the possibility of easily switching stack and communication technology.

It has been tested with SUMO v1.6.0, v1.7.0, v1.8.0, v1.12.0, v1.18.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04.
Back compatibility **is not** ensured with new versions of TraCI.
